# Image Filtering and Fourier Transform Analysis

This repository contains MATLAB code for image filtering and Fourier Transform analysis in the frequency domain. It demonstrates how to apply various filters and visualize their effects on images using Fourier Transform techniques.

## Features
- Load and process grayscale images.
- Apply frequency domain filters:
  - Ideal Low-Pass Filter
  - Gaussian Low-Pass Filter
  - Gaussian High-Pass Filter
  - Butterworth Low-Pass Filter
- Visualize:
  - Original and filtered images.
  - Magnitude spectra of images.
  - 3D surface plots of magnitude spectra.
- Demonstrate zero-padding effects on frequency resolution.
